## Why we are here
The OpenAPI SDK generation ecosystem is a mess. The only actual open source project out there has thousands of issues and doesnt work for most users. The proprietary ones force vendor lock-in, are hard to maintain and update, and make it difficult for devs to implement custom code without it being completely overwritten. The community deserves better.

## What we do
We are an open source company who builds open source SDK generators that makes it incredibly easy to build, extend, and maintain SDKs generated from an OpenAPI spec. We do this by providing generated docs, models and handlers that you can easily write custom code to by simply ignoring them in the borea.config.json file (grub syntax) and having them be preserved on regeneration.
The generators are free and open source, but we do offer a service for teams and companies who need more support for their SDKs. Pricing is available on our [pricing page](https://borea.dev/pricing).
